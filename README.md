# 📸 MedtechSnipes

**MedtechSnipes** is a gamified, IRL social app designed exclusively for members of **Medtech@UCI**. Our goal is to bridge the gap between formal club meetings by encouraging spontaneous interactions and community building across the UCI campus.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

The game is simple: **See a member, snap a photo, earn points.**

1. Identify Yourself: Log in and select your profile so the club knows who is on the hunt.
2. The Snipe: When you spot another Medtech member randomly on campus, approach them and take a photo together.
3. Log the Catch: Mark who you "sniped" in the app and upload the photo.
4. Win Prizes: Every snipe earns you points (10 for the sniper, 5 for the sniped). At the end of the quarter, top snipers are eligible for some prize!

> Note: Beyond the competition, these photos help us curate "Quarter in Review" reels, promotional materials, and memories that celebrate our club culture!
